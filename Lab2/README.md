# Lab Summary

## Overview
This notebook focuses on building an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system using OpenAI's Whisper model, specifically targeting the Chinese language. It represents a comprehensive approach to developing and deploying a multilingual ASR system.

## Key Components

### Library Imports and Setup
- Essential libraries like `datasets` and `transformers` are imported.
- Authentication with Hugging Face Hub is established for accessing models and datasets.

### Data Handling
- Utilizes the Mozilla Foundation's Common Voice dataset for Chinese, encompassing training and testing sets.
- Refinement of the dataset by removing irrelevant columns to ensure data quality.
- Processing of audio data to make it compatible with ASR requirements.

### Model Configuration
- Setting up the Whisper model and tokenizer specifically for Chinese language transcription.
- Definition of a custom data collator class tailored for speech-to-text data.

### Feature Extraction and Tokenization
- Extraction of audio features and tokenization of sentences, crucial for training and inference in the ASR model.

### Model Training and Evaluation
- Loading and fine-tuning a pre-trained Whisper model.
- Evaluation of the model's performance using metrics such as Word Error Rate (WER).

### Deployment and Demonstration
- Creation of a Gradio interface for a live demonstration of the Chinese speech recognition system.
- Deployment of the model on Hugging Face Spaces to showcase its practical application.

## Deliverables
The lab delivers a fully functional ASR system focused on Chinese language transcription. This includes the complete source code hosted in a GitHub repository and a live demonstration deployed on Hugging Face Spaces.

This README provides a detailed and definitive overview of the tasks and objectives involved in creating and deploying an ASR system using the Whisper model for Chinese speech recognition.
