Project Overview
In this machine learning-oriented lab project, we delved deep into the Hopsworks platform, focusing particularly on the addition and management of API keys, the connection and operation with Hopsworks using Jupyter Notebook, and the impact of Gradio version updates on machine learning model presentation. The core contents of the project are as follows:

Hopsworks API Keys and Connection to Machine Learning Models:

Learned how to add API keys in Hopsworks and applied them for accessing and operating machine learning models.
Successfully connected to Hopsworks using Jupyter Notebook for training and testing machine learning models.
Challenges in Creating and Configuring Machine Learning Projects:

Created and configured new machine learning projects on Hopsworks, addressing challenges related to permissions, resource limitations, and configuration issues.
Python Environment and Dependency Management for Machine Learning:

Explored handling conflicts in Python virtual environments for machine learning packages and learned to manage project environments using venv.
API Permissions and Integration with Machine Learning Models:

Addressed authorization issues encountered while integrating the Hopsworks REST API with machine learning models.
Impact of Gradio Version Updates on Machine Learning Model Presentation:

Investigated the impact of Gradio library version changes on machine learning model presentations and learned how to adapt to these changes.
Application of Hopsworks Feature Groups in Machine Learning:

Explored adding or modifying Hopsworks feature groups in machine learning models and resolved related conflicts.
Project Deliverables and Deadline
Source Code: Submit the code for the machine learning models via a GitHub repository.
Lab Description: Submit a README.md file in the root directory of the GitHub repository, detailing the nuances and challenges of the machine learning project.
Gradio Applications: Submit public URLs for two Gradio applications, showcasing the functionality and performance of the machine learning models.
